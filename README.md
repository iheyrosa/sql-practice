# SQL Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of SQL query exercises designed to strengthen my database management and analytical skills.

## Dataset Source

The dataset used in this repository was downloaded from Kaggle: [Bike Store Sample Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database). It has been imported into a local database using Microsoft SQL Server for hands-on query practice.

## Purpose

The output of these SQL queries will be used to support my Power BI practice exercises, focusing on data visualization, reporting, and dashboard development for real-world applications.
